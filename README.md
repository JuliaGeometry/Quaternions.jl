[Quaternions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are best known for their suitability
as representations of 3D rotational orientation.
They can also be viewed as an extension of complex numbers.

In JuliaGeometry organization, there is also [Octonions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Octonions.jl).
